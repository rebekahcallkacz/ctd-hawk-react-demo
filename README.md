# React + Vite

This is a GitHub branching demo

## Lesson 1.1

Step 1 is to create a branch for lesson 1.1 and open a PR for it.

## Lesson 1.2

Step 2 is to create a branch for lesson 1.2 FROM lesson 1.1 and open a PR for it. When you open the PR, you want to request to merge it into the lesson 1.1 branch

## Lesson 1.3

We're following the same steps as for 2, but this time, we're going to have to handle changes to `lesson_1_2`
